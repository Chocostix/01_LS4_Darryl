Unit testing is the execution of a complete class, routine or small program that has been written
by a single programmer or team of programmers, which is tested in isolation from the more
complete system.
Unit testing (or component testing) is to test the smallest units or software components in a
program.

Unit testing is usually done by the developer using development tools in their IDE (Integrated
Development Environment).

Unit testing is a type of white-box testing.

Integration testing is the combined execution of two or more classes, packages, components, or
subsystems that have been created by multiple programmers or programming teams. This kind of
testing typically starts as soon as there are two classes to test and continues until the entire
system is complete.
The objective of integration testing is to reveal interface problems as well as conflicts between
integrated parts.

Integration testing is usually done either by the developers or testers.

integration testing is a type of black-box testing.
